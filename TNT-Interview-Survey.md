# Dear Developer

Congratulations on coming this far, now it's time for a technical evaluation.

Through this assessment, we will be evaluating your ability to manipulate the DOM and some basic knowledge about web development. The exercises shall be delivered through a GitHub repository.

The DOM manipulation assessment consists of three exercises and for each of them, we will provide a URL that will serve as the basis for you to perform code manipulations. All the code that you'll write should be runnable into the browser's console.
