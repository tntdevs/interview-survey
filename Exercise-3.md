1. On the tiles section, make the `Alienware Laptops` the first tile just after `Shop All` tile;

2. Since you changed the tiles' order, we need to change the sections' order. So, in the sections below the tiles, make sure to change the `Alienware Laptops` to the first section position instead of `Inspiron Laptops`;

3. Append over the first section a dynamic list of links based on the left ANAV filters categories where each link should take the user to a page with all the applicable filters activated (e.g: _screen size_ should select 11inch, 13inch, 14inch...).

_Ps: On this exercise, you don't need to worry about the mobile and tablet viewports._
